# Scene-Recognition-SVM
In this project, SVMs and Bag of Words were used to identify image scene.
The features were extracted using HOG descriptors. Although, the project gave accuracy under 50%, 
it taught a lot about machine learning and image processing in Python.
The detailed explanations can be found in the scene_recognition_using_SVM_report file.
